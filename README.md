We are initiating the cloud migration of Ubiquity Health Plan Portal. As part of the CMCoE process, we need to complete an assessment to generate a migration scorecard.

Please review the attached questionnaire and provide the required details before the meeting. We will walk through the responses and try to finalize the scorecard during the session.

Also, please feel free to forward this invite/mail to any SMEs or application owners who should be part of this assessment.
